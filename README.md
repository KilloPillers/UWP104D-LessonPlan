# UWP104D-LessonPlan
This code was developed with the intended purpose of implementing my pedagogical approach to teaching a college level computer science course.

Follow the guide below to install Git onto your computer and clone the lessons repository.

1. **Install Git**:

   - If you haven't already, download and install Git on your computer. You can find the official Git installer at [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Get the Repository URL**:

   - On the repository page, click the green "Code" button.

   - A dropdown will appear with an option to clone the repository with HTTPS. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repository URL.

3. **Open a Command Line Interface**:

   - On your computer, open the command line interface. On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell. On macOS and Linux, you can use Terminal.

4. **Choose a Directory for Cloning**:

   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the cloned repository. You can use the `cd` command to change your working directory. For example:

     ```
     cd path/to/your/desired/directory
     ```

5. **Clone the Repository**:

   - In your command line interface, type the following command and replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied in step 2:

     ```
     git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/KilloPillers/UWP104D-LessonPlan)
     ```

   - Press Enter to execute the command.

6. **Repository Cloned**:

   - Git will start downloading the repository to your local machine. Once it's finished, you'll have a copy of the public repository in the directory you chose in step 4.

7. **Access the Cloned Repository**:

   - Use the `cd` command to navigate into the cloned repository's directory:

     ```
     cd UWP104D-LessonPlan
     ```

8. **You're Done!**:

    - You've successfully cloned a public repository. You can now work on the code, make changes, and interact with the repository using Git.

That's it! You've cloned a public repository from GitHub to your local machine.
