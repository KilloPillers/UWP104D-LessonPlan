//In todays exercise you will create a program that will declare 3 variables
//a float that represents pi.
//an int that represents the radius of a circle.
//and a float that represents the area of the circle.
//You will then calculate the area of the circle and print it to the screen
int main() {
  //Declare variables
  
  //Calculate area
  
  //Print area to screen
  std::cout << "The area of the circle is: ";
